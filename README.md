# Scratch files for auto CAN hackery

Just random snippets, these are probably useless to anyone except me in their current form.

## Description

I'm just trying to ensure I don't lose the scratchpadof code that I 
keep rewriting to do basic cleanup. Maybe I'll finally clean it up 
and make it handy and serviceable and DRY. Hah ! just kidding, it's 
way more fun to screw myself over.
